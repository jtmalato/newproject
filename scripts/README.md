# Scripts

This folder contains all code used to process the data and perform the analyses.

-   `scripts/processing`: Data wrangling of data originally from `data/raw`. Processing of data to create data objects.
-   `scripts/analysis`: Where the majority of the analysis will be stored. Preferably, scripts should not be extensively large. Name of documents should be clear.
-   `scripts/utils`: All the R scripts and personal functions that are used in more than one file. Access them through the `source()` function.
